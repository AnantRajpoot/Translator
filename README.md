Developed a feature-rich Android translator app in Kotlin using Google ML Kit for live translation/language ID, and Room DB for persistent history. Integrated Android's native speech recognition and Text-to-Speech engines to provide hands-free voice input and audio playback for pronunciation. Designed and built a polished user interface with Material Design 3, featuring an animated and date-grouped history list using a complex RecyclerView.
